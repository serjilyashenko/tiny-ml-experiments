# ðŸ¤–VanillaJS Binary Neural Network

This is a tiny neural network implemented from scratch in Vanilla JavaScript that learns the XOR function.
It can be trained to calculate AND or OR operations as well.

It has:
- 2 input neurons
- 2 hidden neurons
- 1 output neuron
- Sigmoid activation + manual backpropagation

## Run it

From `xor-js-nn` folder run:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

## Notes
* This is not an efficient implementation.
* No learning rate is used â€” weight updates are direct gradients.
* Purely for educational purposes.
