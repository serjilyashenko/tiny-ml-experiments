# ðŸ§ âœ¨ Tiny ML Experiments 

This repository is going to be a collection of small, self-contained experiments in machine learning, neural networks, and so on.  
The projects are intentionally simple and educational.

## Projects

- 
- [VanillaJS Binary Neural Network](./binary-js-nn) â€” a 2-layer VanillaJS neural network that learns XOR (AND, OR) using backpropagation.

More projects coming soon ðŸš€
